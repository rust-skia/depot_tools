depot_tools_gerrit_auth(7)
==========================

NAME
----
depot_tools_gerrit_auth - Gerrit authentication for depot_tools

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The Chromium linkgit:depot_tools[7] suite contains many tools which
may need to authenticate to Gerrit.

Gerrit uses OAuth for authentication.  For depot_tools, OAuth is
handled by `git-credential-luci`.

Authentication is needed both for Gerrit API calls made by depot_tools
and for operations done directly by Git (e.g., `git push`, `git
fetch`).

For Gerrit API calls, depot_tools uses `git-credential-luci` out of the
box, but for Git, you need to modify your Git configuration to use
`git-credential-luci`.

GIT CONFIGURATION
-----------------

You need to configure Git to authenticate to Gerrit.  While
depot_tools can help set up the necessary configuration (`git cl
creds-check`), you can also do it manually.

You need to add the following lines to your Git config:

[subs="quotes"]
----
[credential "https://chromium.googlesource.com"]
helper =
helper = luci
----

This tells Git to use `git-credential-luci`.  The first empty value
line is needed to reset the helper list to prevent conflicts.

You should copy this for each Gerrit host you use.

For Googlers, see go/chrome-gerrit-auth.
